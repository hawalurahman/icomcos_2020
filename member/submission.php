The goal of the review process is to select a number of papers that will stimulate discussion and the development and dissemination of new knowledge. Some papers will inevitably be more fully developed than others; however, it is hoped that each author will gain insights during the conference that will strengthen their own research and introduce them to other scholars who share their interests.<br><br>
Authors should submit a full paper on/before: May 11th, 2020 (first batch), July 24th, 2020 (second batch). This full paper should identify the central research question and theory base for the research, introduce the most important references and describe the methodology, empirical base, analysis, and results.<br><br>
Each full paper is evaluated by two or three members of the scientific committee. All are well positioned scholars in the field. Each full paper is evaluated using the following points:<br>
    <ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <li> Quality of the proposed contribution to theory and practice</li>
    <li> Originality and appropriateness of the research method</li>
    <li> Technical competence in the development and execution of the research</li>
    <li> Value of the findings in contributing to knowledge and practice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
The organising committee responds to the author(s) noting acceptance or rejection of the full paper. Feedback is provided in all cases. Some author(s) of accepted full papers may be requested to address specific perceived shortcomings or omissions prior to submitting final papers.<br><br>

<b>Author(s)</b><i> of accepted full papers are expected to submit final papers.</i>

Conference registration and participation by the author (or at least one co-author) is required for publication in the conference proceeding.
